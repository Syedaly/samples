next level so for example if this doesn't have it means it doesn't have okay it has only its own just one chain one chain it is root chain and it doesn't have anything yeah but if you want to see an example of if somebody has you know next level you can see here right for example this one has just one level right you can see under that there's a chain only but it doesn't have any sub chain okay okay so and similarly you can see the same example okay like you have this your meta chain and then after your sub like a like a next chain and then sub chain okay the same example the out sum right that I was showing you so you can see here also the same example basically yeah it may come down maybe but yeah like my point is yeah like this is the structure like like this is this is an radiative structure where we have more information as well for example you know this is the hierarchy right I'll show you like three level okay and then after we have a runtime you know like for each process you know how much time it is taking minute and second and and the frequency you know like half frequent these runs monthly weekly or whatever or I know and and in which system and also like this is a flag which you can see okay it has only one level right it has two level like month and chain and if some has you know like all three level you can see like with this flag so like like you know meta and chain and then sub chain so we have this table available and if you see this is okay for you and this is also you know one more technical stuff you know like it's it's something kind of a grouping okay that is for purpose but yeah like you know how the processing are grouping up in which area like you know like the pm or or like for yeah like like it's for functional perspective like you know in which functional area these these processing are grouping up so yeah so this is the this is an summary table you know architecture where we have these columns already available and after that like I'm just trying to finish first two things and then you can jump on to your topic so this is your summary level and then after you have your basically you know next level like you know like like step so if you want to see for example if you want to see one chain right so I just wanted to show you like okay if you want to join in the next level so what I'm trying to say we have put it out in a next like it like a separate table okay because these are steps and it requires you know more logic to find the sequence number blah blah etc right so so because of that we wanted to keep it separate okay so I'm just picking one example of one process to show you you know how the steps are formed okay So if you see, 
right, this is the next table which you can join, of course, from the previous table by like by the chain, okay. So but it is this table is the detail table like when you like a step level, you know, like step by step, you can see what each step is doing, okay. 
So I picked one table and I show you parallelly the parallelly I want to show you in the system, you know, so that you can understand more better way the same, let me open the same process sheet here, yeah, so if I open the same chain here, so you can see, right, so okay, so if you understand from that way, so you can see, right, this is my outer chain which has two nodes parallel, okay, so if you see, 
right, one step number, it means these two nodes are parallel and what are those two nodes, you can see the name here and type as well, okay, name is again a chain, right, like I said it is a nested, like it could have a, under that it could have a chain also, right, so it has one chain and then another one is loading, so loading is in our term, loading is nothing but, you know, like like a data comes from source table, 
like from a source system to our raw basically, you know, so that is happening here, you can see, right, these two are happening parallel, so we are, you know, we are basically storing this information in tabular form like step by, we have this flag which shows, okay, what are the parallel nodes, okay, and then serialize, like, okay, next are the serialized, you can see, right, all these steps are happening, 
and what they are doing, what are the logic in between, we have captured, you know, all in this table, basically all steps are covered, you know, through that way, and what are those steps, you can see, step id, so these are, again, these, to join further we have this column we will discuss later like to linking the other table but yeah like after that we need to join based on the chain ID and step ID why because now that it has right more steps like you know like it has own step so we need this will work as in linking key right from like for other tables that will come you know later we will discuss later but as of now I just wanted to show you first two tables those are summary and you know and the step level details covering part and yeah in this table you will see right if a filter is applicable or not right if it is yes so our next table is basically after that will come based on just filter that okay so that but yeah but in this table we are marking you know filter like in which step we have any kind of filter okay so we are covering any sort of filter again I don't know, 
like in current word, because I think in current word, it's not like in AWS, right? You are not going to apply any logic in the raw level, right? Because, right, so you may, so that filter part, you may need to think, like, you know, like when you will move from process to analytics, there you have to, because for us, yeah, it is like kind of a pre-processing, we are, before loading itself, okay? 
We are not loading the entire data. We have put this filter during the load itself, okay, into our system. So, yeah, so that, that, I don't know, like, how do you, yeah, like, like, do you adjust? But, yeah, that is one point. 
I think this point, yeah, maybe you can discuss, like, in current word, we have filters on the initial level, like, you know, before bringing the data, and I don't think so. You are allowed to do on your level, or if allowed, you can check, okay, that part. 
But, yeah, in this table, you can see more information, like, you know. Is there, why the filters are there at this level? Yeah, yeah. Because of. Yeah, so it's a reason, right, so, yeah, so it's like a customized data. 
For example, you just want to load daily last three months of data, not the entire data, right? And they don't have any delta capability, okay? So, it's, like, it's about the delta feature. Maybe, in your case also, if you, like, in click, right, if we do a delta, there we can do it, okay? 
So, that we can discuss, okay, that part. But, yeah, this is a point. Other than delta, is there something else? Because, see, basically, expectation is, is there, there was any requirement other than delta? 
Was there any other feature in time, please? Yeah, I mean, we have, yeah, we have many, we need to check, like, one by one, like, there are many, right? Okay, so, yeah, I got it, but is that, is there a reason, in terms of the, because we don't want, like, there are a lot of volume of data, and we didn't want a lot of volume. 
We wanted to say certain things or was there any technical reason we had a technical reason yet Technical reason like I said, right like if some data source are not data capable So instead of loading the entire data daily, right you just do like last three months of data only that is you know Just just from up like I mean just to avoid, you know daily full load, right? 
So that is one reason because there are in a city there are many acceptor where you don't have For you know data capability, right? That's why so you do kind of a customized and in some cases Requirement also right like they just they just need they are just interested You know the latest data like last three months of data only it depends right? 
Like I said, right it depends, you know Table to table or requirement requirement How would we handle that in quickly yet Because if the load is going to, I understand like load would come through quick and click replicate and if there are dentas enabled I think doesn't matter we will do it but if there is going to be full load which is going to take a lot of time then that needs more discussion on really do we do full loads every day or do we do some customization what has been done in the past like what we have done earlier. 
Correct correct. So yeah in Calyc maybe you can apply it there they have a delta customized delta facility as well so but yeah that you can I mean that this would be listed down like this is a raw level where they are doing the finter yeah if you see right PSA whenever you see target is PSA that is a raw level you know happening so PSA is our persistent you know staging area like our raw data you know load side area so that that we are applying yeah. 
So these stages know after that in AWS perspective we will be having raw process analytics and everything right in terms of SAP the target system that you are showing here is whichever the things that you will be showing or the output summary that you have been showed or output is that considered as a initial set of from the landing to raw is that the stage that it is. 
No no no it has all stages so like like here you see right this is the complete stage like tell analytics so if you see right our we have a cube right see so this is terminology like like we have a if you see like a naming convention that we follow or opens you know your ODSO that is nothing but your process layer okay and then you have a CQ Q is you know fact dimension table like which is your basically your analytics layer. 
So we like these have so basically you just understand so all it's an entire step function what is doing from raw to analytics you know every step is there okay okay so you go step by step you see right step number so that that I mean like the step number is nothing but that shows you know for the but again like I said it step function is contains one more step function right so that is change right so so basically if you understand if you think about it as a you know overall perspective so like this is your any step function right which is which is processing your step function you know this way but parallelly it has nested right step function inside that one more right this one yeah parallelly that time yeah yeah yeah so so yeah so if you understand it's an like a overall you know just try to understand like you know I'm just trying to explain like it has like a board so when you when you take the steps of this team it will show you this also as a step right because this needs to be triggered under that but if you want to see the detail of this particular that that is available also right in the in the same table because right now I have put it hard coded right only outage that's why it will not it will only show steps of this particular chain okay this step function like for outage only it will show so whatever we step under that it will show me only those steps okay the step steps that you have been explained here it is a chain is a parent kind of thing unloading and where is exactly the logical implementation of or any any procedure that is getting triggered and doing some logic and proceed proceeding to to the next step yeah so so so like the logic and all right like we said so here we have only steps and we will go right like detail in detail like in each table so like basically we have splitted the entire you know like a like a data flow into multiple tables just to cover because if we put all things in one place it will not you know like work or it may compute so if you just understand our first table is giving you just a high level hierarchical structure of process chain what are all process chains what are the dependencies like you know the sequencing and all and for each processing next table will give me me the step by step flow okay and now the next table after that you would have like you just think about step by step you are going into you are digging more right next level so now the next level next level means like the next table when I will show you that is that is a separate table for only four filters you know like what are this filter because here I just marked the filter okay this step has some filter okay but what are those filters so those filters are covered in the next next table so if you see right filter out so here if I show you the same chain okay if I show you the filter for same chain so you would see the you know if you remember right in the previous one okay let me let me let's keep the previous one executed okay so if you see that this is the right here step level you see right you have a filter in four places right one two three four correct so in the next table you would see only those four okay and what are those four so you would see here okay what are those four again this is you know again like this is again not in detail again it is I will I will tell you so this is again what are those filter like if you understand your secondary logic right so secondary logic We need to.
