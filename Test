Feature	S3 Tables with Iceberg	Iceberg Tables in Athena
Performance	Up to 3x faster query performance and up to 10x higher transactions per second due to optimizations and managed maintenance tasks. (aws.amazon.com)	Performance depends on manual optimizations and infrastructure management in Athena. Can be slower than S3Tables as Athena queries Iceberg files directly in S3.
Maintenance	Automatically handles table maintenance tasks such as compaction and snapshot management, ensuring efficient query performance and storage optimization over time. (aws.amazon.com)	Maintenance must be handled manually. You may need to manage compactions and snapshots on your own, which could require additional steps for optimization.
Integration	Integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing for seamless querying and visualization using AWS analytics services like Amazon Athena, Redshift, EMR, and QuickSight. (aws.amazon.com)	Integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog or other tools like Redshift and QuickSight requires manual configuration. Athena needs to access Iceberg data directly from S3 and may need additional setup for seamless querying.
Schema Evolution	Supports schema evolution, allowing users to add, rename, or remove columns without disrupting the underlying data. (docs.aws.amazon.com)	Athena supports Iceberg schema evolution, but manual setup and handling might be required to manage the schema in the Athena environment.
Data Versioning	Provides data versioning, enabling time-travel queries to access historical data versions. (docs.aws.amazon.com)	Iceberg tables in Athena also support data versioning, but you’ll need to manage the versioning manually through queries or by using additional tools for tracking changes.
Access Control	Offers table-level access controls, allowing for fine-grained permissions management. (aws.amazon.com)	Access control is more manual in Athena. You can use AWS IAM for general access but may need additional layers (like S3 policies or manual data encryption) for fine-grained control.
Cost	Managed service may have associated costs, but optimizations can lead to cost savings in the long run. (aws.amazon.com)	Costs depend on the queries and data scanned by Athena. Since you’re using S3 storage directly, Athena will charge based on the data processed, which can become costly if queries are not optimized.
