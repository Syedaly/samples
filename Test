Step 1: Prepare the S3 Data
Upload the data files to the appropriate S3 bucket, ensuring they are organized into partitioned folders (e.g., s3://bucket-name/folder/partition_key=partition_value/).
Step 2: Create a Glue Database
Navigate to the AWS Glue service.
Create a new Glue database (e.g., my_database) to logically group the tables.
Step 3: Create a Glue Table with Partitions
Use the Glue Table creation wizard:
Specify the table name (e.g., my_table).
Set the database as the one created in Step 2.
Provide the S3 path where the partitioned data resides.
Define the schema (columns and data types).
Add partition keys (e.g., state, year).
Step 4: Configure the AWS Athena Workspace
Open AWS Athena.
Ensure the correct S3 location for query results is set in Query Results Settings.
Select the Glue database created in Step 2 from the Athena console.
Step 5: Query Data Using SQL
Run a SQL query in the Athena query editor to access the data.
Example: SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE state = 'CA';
Step 6: Refresh Partitions (if necessary)
If new partitioned data is added to S3, use:
sql
Copy code
MSCK REPAIR TABLE my_table;
