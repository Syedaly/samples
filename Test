cannot directly query data in Deep Archive; you must first restore it. -> this means the below statement that take time to restore ?

Retrieval Time from Deep Archive:

Standard Tier: 12-48 hours
Bulk Tier: 48+ hours (cheaper but slower)

Standard Tier: Typically takes between 12 to 48 hours to restore the data. After the restoration, you can access and query it.

Bulk Tier: This is cheaper but slower, with restoration time usually exceeding 48 hours.

Once the data is restored, you can perform queries on it, but the process can be slow due to the restoration time. If you need faster access, the Standard Tier would be preferable, but if cost is a concern and speed is less critical, the Bulk Tier could be a better option.
