or example I have 19 files in csv format in landing bucket and consider each file of 1GB. Now I have created schemas for all 19 files to support iceberg format and ran each in Athena query engine. (As part of iceberg creation, it created data metadata and data(with required partitions) . Now I want to automate this process of picking the files from S3 landing and assume that I have one schema file need to pick this up and create in table in iceberg format and execute each in Athena. Typically thru terraform and use which ever best resurces like lambda or python or etc.. get one simple example. Now get the cost comaprision with EDE is this iceberg is still a good option to opt for?
